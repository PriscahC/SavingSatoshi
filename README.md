# Bitcoin Learning Journey 🚀

A hands-on exploration of Bitcoin's technical foundations through practical exercises and simulations.

## 📖 What I've Learned

### Chapter 1: The Genesis Block
- Decoded the Genesis Block's coinbase message using hex-to-ASCII conversion
- Explored OP_RETURN for storing messages on the blockchain

### Chapter 2: Mining & Cryptography
- Built a Node.js mining script to find SHA-256 hashes with five leading zeros
- Understood how Proof of Work secures the network through computational difficulty
- Simulated mining 100 blocks, processing 350,000 transactions
- Learned about miner economics: block subsidies + transaction fees

### Chapter 3: Mining Pools & 51% Attacks

- Experienced a simulated 51% attack scenario with empty block mining
- Learned about the Stratum protocol and extraNonce mechanism
- Understood how mining pools coordinate work distribution (extranonce1 & extranonce2)
- Explored reward distribution: transaction fees + block subsidy
- Studied pool metrics: hash rate percentage, block found percentage, partial solution percentage
