# PROJECT: WAKALA-AI (Generative & Agentic AI Track)
## Vision: From "Replacing Workers" to "Multiplying Entrepreneurs"

In Kenya’s economy—where **70% of the workforce is informal**—the most novel 
solution uses AI agents to lower the barrier for millions to run formal businesses.

### 1. The "Lugha-Action" Stack (Technical Novelty)
* **Linguistic Layer:** Fine-tuned lightweight models (Mistral/Llama 3) 
    on Sheng and Swahili business vernacular.
* **The M-Pesa Agent:** Tooling to reconcile statements and calculate 
    KRA filings from digital footprints.
* **Sovereign Data:** RAG focused on the Kenyan Companies Act and Tax Laws.

### 2. Job Creation Impact
1. **The AI-Enabled Agency:** Creating the "Digital Agent Manager" role.
2. **Bypassing Bureaucracy:** Reducing the cost of formality.
3. **Supply Chain Coordination:** Autonomous negotiation for bulk buying.
